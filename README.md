## Prerequisites

This gem requires *ImageMagick* to run. You can easily install it with *homebrew*:

```shell
brew update && brew install ImageMagick
```

## Install

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'heatmap'
```

And then execute:

```ruby
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself:

```ruby
gem install heatmap
```

## Usage

Using `heatmap` is as easy as 1,2,3:

**1)** Create a new *Map* object:

```ruby
map = Heatmap.new #same as Heatmap::Map.new
```

**2)** Add *Area* objects to the map:

```ruby
map << Heatmap::Area.new(x, y, alpha)
```

**3)** Output the generated heatmap:

```ruby
map.output(filename)
```
